5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions?
Firstly, I need to add some arguments in my hadler.py.
Then, pass different arguments:
    for slack-request: replace the <your_input_string> with different arguments. I can add more arguments.
    for slack-interactive: replace the <Your_input_json> with different arguments. I can add more arguments.


6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs?
In order to let slack-interactive function to react to different inputs, I will get the request which is "req" in the function and write some condition functions to make different response base on the inputs, such as checking the input format and based on different conditions, we need return different results.
